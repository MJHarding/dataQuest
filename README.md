# dataQuest
hackathon code for TensorBros ( Matt Harding + Jamie Garvin ) 

## Objective for hackathon
-  find 3 valuable 10 x 10 plots of land and claim them before anyone else
-  Sell our claimed resources at the best time

## Data Set
- 4 CSV resource files, with the abundance of each resource in each cell
- 1 CSV of historical price points for each resource for interpretation to set sell conditions

## Things that could be improved
- Speed, so implement a dynamic approach, such as a modified kadanes algorithm
- add computational interpretation such as regression for estimating price points in future 

## Things we did well
- Worked well together
- Implemented visualisation of data better than other teams, such as heatmaps etc
